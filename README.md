# Arduino_Projects

These are the list of projects based on Arduino that I did while pursuing the Embedded Systems trainee at TIMTS institute(INDIA) course. I implemented several projects such as obstacle avoiding car using IR(INFRARED SENSOR), object following car using IR sensor,  Obstacle avoiding car using Ultrasonic sensor and so on. You can check the whole set of projects in the arduino projects folder.
